<p>Dear Player, the development team wants to share these notes with you to try and improve the experience.</p>

<p><strong>1.The AI&#39;s are&nbsp;not deterministic</strong>, meaning the same input does not always produce the same result. Therefore, despite numerous tests, sometimes it simply doesn&#39;t work as it should.</p>

<p><strong>2.Herika is not a character from Skyrim</strong>. She is an AI interpreting a character from Skyrim. Sometimes, she may misinterpret and break certain rules. If that happens, just remind her not to do it.</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong>The <strong>GPT-4</strong> model is more expensive and slower than <strong>GPT-3.5</strong>, but significantly better. It adheres better to the rules of roleplay and makes more logical decisions. The functionality of commands/actions with this model is much better. Our base model remains <strong>GPT-3.5</strong>, but sometimes it doesn&#39;t work well. Over time, GPT-4 will become the reference model through &quot;natural&quot; evolution, so we know we are on the right track.</p>

<p><strong>4. Adjust the prompts</strong>. Create the files prompts_custom.php and command_prompt_custom.php. Look at the variables defined in the original prompts.php and command_prompt.php, and redefine them in their respective custom files. Example:</p>

<pre>
<code class="language-php">// We have this in prompts.php

 "goodmorning"=&gt;[
        "(Complete the text replacing the hashtag #CHAT#)(Generate chat completion for $HERIKA_NAME commenting about {$GLOBALS["PLAYER_NAME"]}'s nap )  $HERIKA_NAME: #CHAT#",
        "(waking up after sleep). ahhhh  "
    ],</code></pre>

<p>So we can write in prompts_custom.php this new definition:</p>

<pre>
<code class="language-php">$PROMPTS["goodmorning"]=
    [
        "(Complete the text replacing the hashtag #CHAT#)(Generate chat completion for $HERIKA_NAME laughing at {$GLOBALS["PLAYER_NAME"]}'s hair )  $HERIKA_NAME: #CHAT#",
        "(waking up after sleep). ahhhh  "
    ];</code></pre>

<p>you can disabled some events just adding this named key &quot;extra&quot;. Take a look in prompts.php to see another interesting properties.</p>

<pre>
<code class="language-php">$PROMPTS["goodmorning"]=
    [
        "(Complete the text replacing the hashtag #CHAT#)(Generate chat completion for $HERIKA_NAME laughing at {$GLOBALS["PLAYER_NAME"]}'s hair )  $HERIKA_NAME: #CHAT#",
        "(waking up after sleep). ahhhh  ",
        "extra"=&gt;["dontuse"=&gt;true]
    ];</code></pre>

<p>command_prompt_custom.php follow the same rules, but be cautious as that file contains important rule prompts.</p>

<p>This way we can release updates with new prompts definitions for new events, and your customized prompts will always overwrite vanilla ones. 
GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 work different with the same prompts, so customizing is the way to go to fit your best experience.</p>

<p><strong>5. Disabling functions</strong>. Just create the file functions_custom.php (top level dir, same directory level as conf.php), and just redeclare there enabled functions array.Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">
$ENABLED_FUNCTIONS=[
    'Inspect',
    'LookAt',
    'InspectSurroundings',
    //'MoveTo',             // Will not be available
    'OpenInventory',
    'Attack',
    'Follow',
    'CheckInventory',
    'SheatheWeapon',
    'Relax',
    //'LeadTheWayTo',       // Will not be available
    //'TakeASeat',          // Will not be available
    'ReadQuestJournal',
    'SetSpeed',
    'GetDateTime',
    'SearchDiary',
    'SetCurrentTask'
];
</code></pre>
