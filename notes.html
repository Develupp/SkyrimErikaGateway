                        Meaning the same input does not always produce the same result. Therefore, despite numerous tests, sometimes it
                        simply doesn't work as it should.

                        She is an AI interpreting a character from Skyrim. Sometimes, she may misinterpret and break certain rules. If that
                        happens, just remind her not to do it.

                            The <u>GPT-4</u> model is more expensive and slower than <u>GPT-3.5</u>, but significantly better

                        It adheres better to the rules of roleplay and makes more logical decisions. The functionality of commands/actions
                        with this model is much better. Our base model remains <strong>GPT-3.5</strong>, but sometimes it doesn't work well. 
                        Over time, GPT-4 will become the reference model through "natural" evolution, so we know we are on the right track.

                        <div class="fw-bold">Error Phrases</div>
                        Herika has certain phrases that are for when there is an error with the AI generation. It is a good idea to check the Log page for more information.
                        <ul>
                            <li>"Didn't hear you, can you repeat?" = There is an error connecting to OpenAI/Local LLM</li>
                            <li>"Be quiet, I'm having a flashback, give me a minute" = To many request being sent to OpenAI/Local LLM</li>
                            <li>"I can't think clearly now..." = You broke OpenAI's useage policy</li>
                          </ul>
                    </div>
                </li>

                <li class="list-group-item d-flex justify-content-between align-items-start">
                    <div class="ms-2 me-auto">
                        <div class="fw-bold">Adjust the prompts</div>
                        Create the files prompts_custom.php and command_prompt_custom.php. Look at the variables defined in the original
                        prompts.php and command_prompt.php, and redefine them in their respective custom files. Example:

                        <pre><code class="language-php">// We have this in prompts.php
"goodmorning"=&gt;[
    "(Complete the text replacing the hashtag #CHAT#)(Generate chat completion for $HERIKA_NAME commenting about {$GLOBALS["PLAYER_NAME"]}'s nap )  $HERIKA_NAME: #CHAT#",
    "(waking up after sleep). ahhhh  "
],
</code>
                        </pre>

                        So we can write in prompts_custom.php this new definition:

                        <pre><code class="language-php">$PROMPTS["goodmorning"]=
[
    "(Complete the text replacing the hashtag #CHAT#)(Generate chat completion for $HERIKA_NAME laughing at {$GLOBALS["PLAYER_NAME"]}'s hair )  $HERIKA_NAME: #CHAT#",
    "(waking up after sleep). ahhhh  "
];</code></pre>

                        You can disable some events by just adding this named key "extra". Take a look in prompts.php to see
                        other interesting properties.

                        <pre><code class="language-php">$PROMPTS["goodmorning"]=
[
    "(Complete the text replacing the hashtag #CHAT#)(Generate chat completion for $HERIKA_NAME laughing at {$GLOBALS["PLAYER_NAME"]}'s hair )  $HERIKA_NAME: #CHAT#",
    "(waking up after sleep). ahhhh  ",
    "extra"=&gt;["dontuse"=&gt;true]
];</code></pre>

                        command_prompt_custom.php follow the same rules, but be cautious as that file contains important rule prompts.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        This way we can release updates with new prompts definitions for new events, and your customized prompts will
                        always overwrite vanilla ones. GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 work different with the same prompts, so customizing is the way
                        to go to fit your best experience.
                    </div>
                </li>

                <li class="list-group-item d-flex justify-content-between align-items-start">
                    <div class="ms-2 me-auto">
                        <div class="fw-bold">Disabling functions</div>
                        Just create the file functions_custom.php (top level dir, same directory level as conf.php), and just redeclare
                        there enabled functions array.Example:

                        <pre><code class="language-php">$ENABLED_FUNCTIONS=[
    'Inspect',
    'LookAt',
    'InspectSurroundings',

    'OpenInventory',
    'Attack',
    'Follow',
    'CheckInventory',
    'SheatheWeapon',

    //'LeadTheWayTo',       // Will not be available
    //'TakeASeat',          // Will not be available
    'ReadQuestJournal',
    'SetSpeed',
    'GetDateTime',
    'SearchDiary',
    'SetCurrentTask'
];
